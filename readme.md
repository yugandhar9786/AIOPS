# Day - 1
# 1. Traditional AI in DevOps
Traditional AI relies on structured data, pre-defined rules, and predictive models trained on historical data. It excels at classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection.

# Example: Incident Detection & Prediction
Use Case: Predicting system failures before they occur.
How It Works:
Uses log-based anomaly detection and pattern recognition (e.g., time-series forecasting).
If CPU usage suddenly spikes beyond a threshold, AI predicts a potential issue.
The system alerts DevOps teams to take preventive action.
Limitations:
Works only on pre-trained scenarios.
Cannot generate insights beyond structured input data.



# 2. Generative AI in DevOps
Generative AI (Gen AI) leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze, summarize, and even generate new content dynamically.

# Example: AI-Powered Incident Resolution & RCA
Use Case: Automating root cause analysis (RCA) & remediation.
# How It Works:
Understanding logs & metrics: Gen AI processes unstructured log data, summarizes key issues, and suggests fixes.
Chat-based troubleshooting: DevOps engineers can ask Gen AI:
"Why did my Kubernetes pod crash?" â†’ AI analyzes logs and suggests probable causes like OOM (Out of Memory) errors.
Auto-remediation: AI suggests and even applies fixes (e.g., increasing memory limits in a YAML file).
# Advantages:
No need for extensive labeled training data.
Can generate human-like explanations & solutions.
Adaptable to new/unseen failure patterns.
